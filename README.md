This project contains end-to-end UI automation tests for a sample e-commerce site using **Playwright**.  
Tests cover:

- User login (valid & invalid)
- Add to cart functionality
- Checkout (positive & negative scenarios)
- HTML test reporting

## Framework Choice
We used **Playwright** because:

- Supports UI and API automation
- Fast and reliable
- Cross-browser and mobile testing support
- Built-in reporting, screenshots, and tracing
